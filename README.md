# YARAssassin
Framework for YARA + SpamAssassin

This is work designed to promote a spam control framework that both uses, and enhances, the spam-control functions of Apache's SpamAssassin project.



1) Make more mail objects available to the User or SysAdmin to assist in spam detection.
2) Develop YARA-like rules that can be used to describe spam: Objects, Limits, and Conditions.
